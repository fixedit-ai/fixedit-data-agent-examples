# FixedIT Data Agent Examples

This repository provides resources for the [FixedIT Data Agent ACAP](https://fixedit.ai/products-data-agent/) for the Axis network cameras and other Axis devices.

**üìä Server-side dashboards** - The [dashboard-deployments](./dashboard-deployments) directory contains visualization dashboards that work with the FixedIT Data Agent. Some work directly with the bundled configurations (just spin them up and start visualizing), while others can be used as-is or customized for your needs. Advanced users often combine edge device customization with dashboard modifications to visualize new data types.

The dashboard stack in the image below is the system monitoring example for the bundled configuration in the FixedIT Data Agent, for more details see the [README](./dashboard-deployments/system-monitoring-influxdb2-flux-grafana/README.md) in the dashboard-deployments directory.

**üõ†Ô∏è Edge device customization** - Project implementation examples that show how to extend and customize the FixedIT Data Agent by uploading custom configuration files and scripts. This makes it easy to create tailored edge applications for Axis devices without starting from scratch using the AXIS ACAP SDK.
