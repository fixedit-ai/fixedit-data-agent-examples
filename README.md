## üìä Server-side Dashboards

The [dashboard-deployments](./dashboard-deployments) directory contains visualization dashboards that work with the FixedIT Data Agent. Some work directly with the bundled configurations (just spin them up and start visualizing), while others can be used as-is or customized for your needs. Advanced users often combine edge device customization with dashboard modifications to visualize new data types.

### System Monitoring with InfluxDB2 and Grafana

The dashboard stack in the image below is the system monitoring example for the bundled configuration in the FixedIT Data Agent, for more details see the [README](./dashboard-deployments/system-monitoring-influxdb2-flux-grafana/README.md) in the dashboard-deployments directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Edge Device Customization

Project implementation examples that show how to extend and customize the FixedIT Data Agent by uploading custom configuration files and scripts. This makes it easy to create tailored edge applications for Axis devices without starting from scratch using the AXIS ACAP SDK.

### Creating a Timelapse with AWS S3 Upload

The [Timelapse with AWS S3 Upload](./project-timelapse-s3) project demonstrates automated timelapse video creation using the FixedIT Data Agent. This solution captures images at regular intervals from an AXIS device and uploads them to AWS S3 with timestamped filenames, creating a chronological sequence perfect for timelapse generation. Perfect for construction sites, environmental monitoring, safety applications, or any scenario requiring periodic visual documentation.

The system leverages the FixedIT Data Agent's built-in capabilities to create sophisticated data workflow graphs without traditional embedded programming. This shows that it is possible to work with binary data such as images and video in the FixedIT Data Agent, it also shows how to use the AWS S3 output integration in the FixedIT Data Agent.
