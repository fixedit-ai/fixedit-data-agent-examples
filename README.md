## Server-side Dashboards

The [dashboard-deployments](./dashboard-deployments) directory contains visualization dashboards that work with the FixedIT Data Agent. Some work directly with the bundled configurations (just spin them up and start visualizing), while others can be used as-is or customized for your needs. Advanced users often combine edge device customization with dashboard modifications to visualize new data types.

### System Monitoring with InfluxDB2 and Grafana

The dashboard stack in the image below is the system monitoring example for the bundled configuration in the FixedIT Data Agent, for more details see the [README](./dashboard-deployments/system-monitoring-influxdb2-flux-grafana/README.md) in the dashboard-deployments directory.

## Edge Device Customization Examples

Project implementation examples that show how to extend and customize the FixedIT Data Agent by uploading custom configuration files and scripts. This makes it easy to create tailored edge applications for Axis devices without starting from scratch using the AXIS ACAP SDK.

### Older Examples

Looking for project examples for an older version of the FixedIT Data Agent? You can [browse the tags to find a snapshot](https://github.com/fixedit-ai/fixedit-data-agent-examples/tags) of the repository at that time. Examples will typically be compatible within the same major version and for the same or newer minor. E.g. a project compatible with FixedIT Data Agent v1.1 is compatible with v1.2, v1.3, etc. but not with v1.0 or v0.1. It might or might not work with v2.0 since a new major version typically introduces breaking changes.

### Hello, World!

The [Hello, World!](./project-hello-world) project demonstrates how to use the FixedIT Data Agent to upload custom config files and print messages to the standard output of the Telegraf process, which will be captured by the FixedIT Data Agent and displayed in the `Logs` tab.

The following diagram shows the data flow of the "Hello, World!" project. For more details see the [README](./project-hello-world/README.md) in the `project-hello-world` directory.

### Creating a Timelapse with AWS S3 Upload

The [Timelapse with AWS S3 Upload](./project-timelapse-s3) project demonstrates automated timelapse video creation using the FixedIT Data Agent. This solution captures images at regular intervals from an AXIS device and uploads them to AWS S3 with timestamped filenames, creating a chronological sequence perfect for timelapse generation. Perfect for construction sites, environmental monitoring, safety applications, or any scenario requiring periodic visual documentation.

The system leverages the FixedIT Data Agent's built-in capabilities to create sophisticated data workflow graphs without traditional embedded programming. This shows that it is possible to work with binary data such as images and video in the FixedIT Data Agent, it also shows how to use the AWS S3 output integration in the FixedIT Data Agent.
