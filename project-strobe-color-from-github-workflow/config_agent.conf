# Telegraf Agent Core Configuration for GitHub Workflow Monitoring
#
# This configuration defines the global settings for the Telegraf agent that
# monitors GitHub workflow status and controls Axis strobe light colors.
#
# Key Features:
# - Configures polling interval for GitHub API checks
# - Implements jitter to prevent API rate limiting across multiple devices
# - Controls debug output for troubleshooting
# - Optimized for real-time workflow status monitoring

# Enable debug mode for verbose logging and troubleshooting
# Set to true when diagnosing pipeline issues or during initial setup
# Set to false in production to reduce log volume
debug = ${TELEGRAF_DEBUG}

# Polling interval for GitHub API checks
# This determines how quickly the strobe responds to workflow changes
# The strobe profile duration should be at least as long as this interval
# For production usage, a much longer interval is recommended to avoid
# hitting GitHub's rate limit.
interval = "5s"

# Random delay added to each collection cycle to prevent API rate limiting
# When multiple devices monitor the same repo, this spreads out API calls
# Prevents synchronized requests that could trigger GitHub's rate limiting
# Range: 0 to collection_jitter seconds added randomly to each interval
collection_jitter = "1s"
