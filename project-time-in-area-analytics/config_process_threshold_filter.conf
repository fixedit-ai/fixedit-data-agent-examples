# Threshold Filter Processor
#
# This processor filters detection frames based on time in area threshold.
# Only detections that exceed the configured threshold are passed through.
#
# Input: detection_frame_with_duration metrics with time_in_area_seconds field
# Output: alerting_frame metrics where time_in_area_seconds > ALERT_THRESHOLD_SECONDS
#
# Environment Variables:
# - ALERT_THRESHOLD_SECONDS: Minimum time in area in seconds to trigger alerts (required)
