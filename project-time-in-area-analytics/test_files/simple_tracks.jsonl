# track_001:
#   - Detections: 4 total (3 unverified/null, 1 verified as Human)
#   - Time span: 3.78s (from first detection to last)
#   - First verified: at 3.78s into track (4th detection)
#   - One `operation` to delete track_001 after track_002 appears.
#
# track_002:
#   - Detections: 2 total (2 unverified/null, 0 verified)
#   - Time span: 2.22s (from first to last detection)
#   - First verified: N/A (never verified)
#   - Notes: Completely unverified track. Appears only in frames 3-6.
